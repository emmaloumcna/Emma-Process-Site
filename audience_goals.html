                        <p>My first interview was with one of the audience categories, a possible donor. My interviewee was Linde McNamara a mother, grandmother, and 20 year+ business owner, who’s number one passion is saving the environment, and she values giving back to her community. Her insight and suggestions were very helpful. My biggest takeaway was to rearrange the order and hierarchy of the information on the website. Linde highly suggested putting the organization's vision in a place of prominence, and making the COVID updates smaller and more of a temporary pop-up. She also informed me that the purple worked really well to catch and keep the user’s attention. Finally, I asked her what element would make her want to donate to this cause. She emphatically told me how important the pictures are. Seeing visual evidence that her money was being used to improve the lives of families, is the most important part. </p>
                        <p>I also had the wonderful opportunity to interview The Bulb Marketing Manager, Lisa Wendling! Lisa joined The Bulb team because she wanted a job where she made a positive difference in her community. She provided lots of helpful information and context, like their slogan: “Take what you need, give what you can”. Lisa agreed that the website needed some renovation, and had lots of ideas! She emphasized the need to clean up, simplify, and organize the information currently on the website. She also told me that the biggest goals for the website and branding is to provide useful information in a friendly and approachable way, and attract potential donors and grants. This was all very helpful in the process of renovating this website! </p>
